          <p>
            I’m a <strong>Computer Science</strong> student passionate about building real, working software and continuously improving my technical skills. 
            I enjoy turning ideas into practical projects — from developing Java applications to building and deploying full-stack web solutions.

          <p>
            I actively experiment, debug, and refine my work because I believe real growth comes from <strong>building</strong>. 
            Beyond coding, I’m someone who doesn’t give up easily when things break — I fix them. 
            I’m currently looking for <strong>opportunities</strong> to apply my skills and grow as a software engineer.
